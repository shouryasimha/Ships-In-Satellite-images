Satellite imagery provides unique insights into various markets, including agriculture, defense and intelligence, energy, and finance. New commercial imagery providers, such as Planet, are using constellations of small satellites to capture images of the entire Earth every day.  This flood of new imagery is outgrowing the ability for organizations to manually look at each image that gets captured, and there is a need for machine learning and computer vision algorithms to help automate the analysis process.  The aim  is to help address the difficult task of detecting the location of large ships in satellite images. Automating this process can be applied to many issues including monitoring port activity levels and supply chain analysis.
